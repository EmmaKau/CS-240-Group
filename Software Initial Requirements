Software Initial Requirements

For this project, I will be focusing on creating the internal structure for the navigation
from existing professors to existing feedback threads and the creation of new feeds and sections. 
	I will now outline what the userâ€™s navigation experience will be once the website is created. 
  Once the user has selected a professor, they will have a series of classes that they can choose
  from with a plus tab at the bottom that they can click to add another class. If there are no
  classes that have been created already for that professor then there will only be a plus tab.
  Once you click the plus tab there will be a space where you can you can type the name of the
  class and add it to the system. The user will not be allowed to add if they have not written
  anything. With in the class there will be the exact same format except, instead of classes there
  will be topics. Once the topic has been chosen/created there is are feeds, again with the same
  format. Once in a feed, users can comment or reply to comments. There will be a text box at the
  top of the page that students can write in and click post in order to add to the discussion.
  Alternatively they can reply to a comment by pushing a reply button on a comment and writing in
  a text box. These are all functional requirements. 
	As for non functional requirements, a time efficient navigation system will be optimized for.
  In addition, we will have limited time to create this website so we aim to keep it as simple as
  possible. We also hope to keep the website centered on both creating an improvement mindset for
  teaching and anonymous feedback.
